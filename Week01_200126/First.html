    <h1>MOTA BHAI</h1>
    <p>
Amit Shah’s role in the 2002 Gujarat riots has been controversial and widely debated, 
mainly because of the positions he held and the legal cases that followed. 

Here is a clear, factual breakdown:
Position at the time

In <b>2002</b>, Amit Shah was a Gujarat state minister (Minister of State for Home, among other portfolios) under Chief Minister Narendra Modi.
The Home Department was responsible for law and order during the riots.
Allegations & accusations
He was accused by some activists and opposition leaders of:
Administrative failure in controlling violence
Alleged involvement in fake encounter cases that occurred later 
(not directly riot violence, but linked to the same period of governance)

<b>Legal proceedings</b>
The CBI investigated Amit Shah in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case.
In 2014, a special CBI court discharged Amit Shah, stating there was no prosecutable evidence against him.
The Supreme Court of India later upheld the discharge, effectively clearing him legally.
