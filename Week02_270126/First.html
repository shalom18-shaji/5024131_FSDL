        <h1>MOTA BHAI</h1>

        <p>
    The <strong>Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)</strong> is one of India’s two major national political parties and is
    currently the most influential political force at the Centre. Founded in <strong>1980</strong>, the party
    draws its ideological inspiration from Indian nationalism and the philosophy of Hindutva, emphasizing cultural
    identity, national unity, and self-reliance. Over the decades, the BJP has evolved from a relatively small
    political organization into a dominant national party with a strong organizational structure and grassroots
    presence across the country.<br><br>



    A major turning point in the party’s history occurred in <strong>2014</strong>, when the BJP secured a clear
    parliamentary majority under the leadership of Narendra Modi. This victory marked a decisive shift from
    coalition-era politics to strong central leadership. The party repeated its majority win in <strong>2019</strong>
    and continues to lead the government after the <strong>2024 elections</strong> through the NDA alliance,
    reinforcing its long-term dominance in Indian politics.<br><br>

    

    <strong>In conclusion,</strong> the Bharatiya Janata Party has played a transformative role in reshaping the
    political landscape of India. By moving from fragmented coalition politics to sustained electoral dominance,
    it has emerged as one of the most powerful and influential parties in the democratic history of the country.
