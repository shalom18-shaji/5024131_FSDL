The <strong>Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)</strong> is one of India’s two major national political parties and 
currently the dominant political force at the Centre.<br> It was founded in <b>1980</b>, with its ideological roots in Indian nationalism and the philosophy of Hindutva.
The BJP emerged as a strong national party in the 1990s, first forming a short-lived government in 1996 under Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and later leading stable coalition governments from 1998 to 2004.<br> Its biggest political breakthrough came in 2014, when it won a clear majority under Narendra Modi, ending decades of coalition dependence. <br>The party repeated its majority win in 2019 and continues to lead the government after the 2024 elections through the NDA alliance.<br>
The BJP focuses on strong central leadership, national security, economic reforms, infrastructure development, and cultural identity.<br> Over the years, it has expanded its presence across most Indian states, transforming from a cadre-based party into a pan-India political organization.<br>
In short:<br>
The BJP has reshaped Indian politics by moving from coalition-era politics to long-term dominance, making it one of the most influential parties in India’s democratic history.
